FrameReceiver
=============

FrameReceiver is an application to enable reception of frames of detector data transmitted over a network connection 
as a UDP stream. FrameReceiver constructs data frames in shared memory buffers and communicates with external 
applications to allow processing and storage.

External Software Dependencies
==============================

The following libraries and packages are required:

* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) : build management system (version >= 2.8)
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org) : portable C++ utility libraries. The following components are used - program_options, unit_test_framework, date_time, interprocess, bimap (version >= 1.41)
* [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org) : high-performance asynchronous messaging library (version >= 3.2.4)
* [Log4CXX](http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/): Configurable message logger (version >= 0.10.0)
* [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5): __Optional:__ if found, the filewriter application will be built (version >= 1.8.14) 

Installing dependencies
-----------------------

The supported development platform is Linux RedHat 6 (RHEL6) however distributions like CentOS and Scientific 
Linux are essentially clones of RHEL and can be used as free alternatives to RHEL.

Most of the dependencies are available from the RHEL (or CentOS) repositories, but a few (log4cxx and zeromq) 
must be installed from the EPEL repository (or built from source).

The following is an exmaple of installing dependencies on CentOS 6:

    # Install the development environment: gcc, make, etc.
    yum groupinstall "Development tools"
    
    # Install the cmake and boost libraries
    yum install cmake boost-devel
    
    # Enable the EPEL repositories - the exact method may be dependent
    # on the distribution. This works for CentOS 6:
    yum install epel-release
    
    # Install the zeromq and log4cxx libraries from the EPEL repo
    yum --enablerepo=epel install zeromq3-devel log4cxx-devel


Building
========

FrameReceiver is built using CMake and make. FrameReceiver is configured and built with the following commands:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=ON ..
    make

The Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=ON flag is required on systems with Boost installed on system paths (e.g. from a package 
repository) where there is a bug in the installed CMake package discovery utilities. Non-default installations of 
the above libraries and packages can be used by setting the following flags:

* BOOST_ROOT
* ZEROMQ_ROOTDIR
* LOG4CXX_ROOT_DIR
* HDF5_ROOT

Applications are compiled into the `bin` directory within `build` and the additional python etc tools installed into 
tools. Sample configuration files for testing the system are installed into `test_config`.  See the sections below 
further information on usage. 


Usage
=====

In addition to the core FrameReceiver application, there are a number of associated tools that can be used in 
conjunction to operate a system. These are described below.

Running the FrameReceiver
-------------------------

The frameReceiver is a C++ compiled application and is configured by a combination of command-line options
and equivalent parameters stored in an INI-formatted configuration file. The command-line options take
precedence over the configuration file if specified. The options and their default values can be viewed 
by invoking the`--help` option:

	$ bin/frameReceiver --help
	usage: frameReceiver [options]
	
	
	Generic options:
	  -h [ --help ]         Print this help message
	  -v [ --version ]      Print program version string
	  -c [ --config ] arg   Specify program configuration file
	
	Configuration options:
	  -d [ --debug ] arg (=0)                Set the debug level
	  -n [ --node ] arg (=1)                 Set the frame receiver node ID
	  -l [ --logconfig ] arg                 Set the log4cxx logging configuration 
	                                         file
	  -m [ --maxmem ] arg (=1048576)         Set the maximum amount of shared 
	                                         memory to allocate for frame buffers
	  -s [ --sensortype ] arg (=unknown)     Set the sensor type to receive frame 
	                                         data from
	  -p [ --port ] arg (=8989,8990)         Set the port to receive frame data on
	  -i [ --ipaddress ] arg (=0.0.0.0)      Set the IP address of the interface to
	                                         receive frame data on
	  --sharedbuf arg (=FrameReceiverBuffer) Set the name of the shared memory 
	                                         frame buffer
	  --frametimeout arg (=1000)             Set the incomplete frame timeout in ms
	  -f [ --frames ] arg (=0)               Set the number of frames to receive 
	                                         before terminating
	  --packetlog arg (=0)                   Enable logging of packet diagnostics 
	                                         to file
	  --rxbuffer arg (=30000000)             Set UDP receive buffer size

The meaning of the configuration options are as follows:

* `-h` or `--help`

   Print the help message shown above.

* `-v` or `--version`
   
   Print the program version string (to be implemented).

* `-c` or `--config` 

   Specify the program configuration file to be loaded.
   
* `-d` or `--debug`
 
   Specify the debug level. Increasing the value increases the verbosity of the debug output.
   
* `-n` or `--node`

   Set the frame receiver node ID. Identifies the node in a multi-receiver system.
   
* `-l` or `--logconfig`

   Set the log4cxx logging configuration file to use, which configures the format and destination
   of logging output from the application. See the README.md file in the `config` directory for
   more information.
   
* `-m` or `--maxmem`

   Set the maximum amount of shared memory to allocate for frame buffers. This memory is where
   received frames are stored and handed off for processing by e.g. the fileWriter.
   
* `-s` or `--sensortype`

   Set the sensor type to receive frame data from. This a string parameter describing which 
   type of data the receiver should expect. Currently only a type of `percivalemulator` is
   supported.
   
* `-p` or `--port`

   Set the port(s) to receive frame data on, specified as a comma-separated list, e.g. `8989,8990`.
  
* `-i`  or `--ipaddress`

   Set the the IP address to listen for data on. The default value of `0.0.0.0` listens on all
   available network interfaces.
    
* `--sharedbuf`

   Set the name of the shared memory frame buffer to use. Needs to match the name used by the
   downstream processing task, e.g. the fileWriter.
   
* `--frametimeout`

   Set the timeout in milliseconds for releasing incomplete frames (i.e. those missing 
   packets) to the downtream processing task.
   
* `-f` or `--frames`

   Set the number of frames to receive before terminating. The frameReceiver will wait for
   those frames to be released by the processing task before terminating. The default 
   value of 0 means run indefinitely.
   
* `--packetlog`
 
   Set to a non-zero value to enable logging of packet diagnostics to a separate log file,
   whose format and destination are configured in the logging configuration file. __NOTE__ Turning
   this option on will produce large quantities of output and significantly impact on the
   performance of the frameReceiver.
   
* `--rxbuffer`

   Set UDP receive buffer size in bytes.
 
An example configuration file `fr_test.config` i.s available in the `config` directory. Typical
invocation of the frameReceiver in a test would be as follows:

	bin/frameReceiver --config test_config/fr_test.config --logconfig test_config/fr_log4cxx.xml --debug 2 --frames 3
   
   

Running the FileWriter
----------------------

The filewriter application communicate with the frameReceiver and receives notifications when
incoming image frames are ready to be processed and written to disk. The frame data is transferred
through a shared memory interface (i.e. the `--sharedbuf` argument) to minimise the required
number of copies. Once a frame has been processed, the memory is handed back to the frameReceiver
to be re-used. 

The application can be used as a diagnostic without actually writing data to files: if the
`-o/--output` filename is not given, the application will still communicate with the frameReceiver; 
receiving and releasing frames, but without writing data to disk.

This application is intended to run as part of a large system with multiple servers concurrently
acquiring data from the frontend electronics. Although the application does not communicate with
other instances it can be made aware of the number of filewriter processes - and it's
own rank (or index) in the overall system. This lets it calculate suitable dataset offsets for writing
frames, received in the "temporal mode" (i.e. round robin between all DAQ servers).

### Commandline Interface

The following options and arguments can be given in the usual fashion where defaults can be configured
in a configuration file (`-c,--config`) - but overriden by a user on the commandline:

	bin/filewriter --help
	usage: filewriter [options]
	
	
	Generic options:
	  -h [ --help ]         Print this help message
	  -c [ --config ] arg   Specify program configuration file
	
	Configuration options:
	  -l [ --logconfig ] arg                 Set the log4cxx logging configuration 
	                                         file
	  --ready arg (=tcp://127.0.0.1:5001)    Ready ZMQ endpoint from frameReceiver
	  --release arg (=tcp://127.0.0.1:5002)  Release frame ZMQ endpoint from 
	                                         frameReceiver
	  -f [ --frames ] arg (=1)               Set the number of frames to be 
	                                         notified about before terminating
	  --sharedbuf arg (=FrameReceiverBuffer) Set the name of the shared memory 
	                                         frame buffer
	  -o [ --output ] arg                    Name of HDF5 file to write frames to 
	                                         (default: no file writing)
	  -p [ --processes ] arg (=1)            Number of concurrent file writer 
	                                         processes
	  -r [ --rank ] arg (=0)                 The rank (index number) of the current
	                                         file writer process in relation to the
	                                         other concurrent ones

### Limitations

Currently the application has a number of limitations (which will be addressed):

 * No internal buffering: the application currently depend on the buffering available in the frameReceiver.
   If the filewriter cannot keep up the pace it will not release frames back to the frameReceiver in time,
   potentially causing the frameReceiver to run out of buffering and drop frames. Fortunately missing frames
   are obvious in the output files (as empty gaps)
 * Metadata like the "info" field and original frame ID number is not recorded in the file.
 * Sensor data is only stored in raw 16bit format for both gain and reset frames. The fine/coarse ADC and
   gain data can be generated in the file by a post-processing step (see python script 
   `decode_raw_frames_hdf5.py`)


Using the python tools
----------------------

Several python scripts in this area can be used to emulate parts of the Percival
data acquisition system. This is a summary of the tools and instructions on how to
operate them. There are two options for using the tools: 

* Create a virtual python environment, then install packages and the tools into it.
* Install required python packages and set PYTHONPATH to point at the appropriate location

The virtual environment is the preferred solution since it does not require system privileges
to install packages.

__NOTE__ The `h5py` python bindings require the HDF5 libraries to be installed on your system (see above). If
not installed into a standard location, set the environment variable `HDF5_DIR` to point to the installation,
prior to either installation method. See the [h5py install instructions](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/build.html) 
for more information.


Installing a Virtual Python Environment
-------------------------------------------

Ensure you have [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) installed in your python environment 
first. Then create and activate a new virtualenv - and finally install the required dependencies with the
following commands:

    # Ensure you are in the "build" directory created above otherwise move into it
    cd <project root>/build
    
    # First create the virtual environment.
    # This need to be done only once for your working copy
    virtualenv -p /path/to/favourite/python venv
    
    # Activate the venv - this need to be done for each shell you work in
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Move into the python directory to install
    cd lib/python
    
    # Install the required dependencies.
    # This step is only required once for each virtualenv
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    # Install the tools into the environment
    # The develop argument allows the underlying tools to be updated from the source in the 
    # build step without requiring the setup script to be run-executed each time
    python setup.py develop
    
    # Move back to the "build" directory
    cd ../..
    

Having set up the virtual environment and installed packages and tools, it can be subsequently
reused simply by activating it with the `source venv/bin/activate` command. The virtual env can 
be exited with the command `deactivate` at any time.

The `setup.py` script creates command-line entry points for the tools in the virtual environment, 
which can be invoked directly, as shown in the descriptions below. 

Installing the required python packages manually
------------------------------------------------

This option is less preferred since system privileges are typically required to install packages
and it is necessary to ensure that PYTHONPATH is set appropriately. The following steps are
required:

	# Install required python packages using pip. This requires system
	# privileges typically, e.g. sudo
	# If pip is not installed in your python environment, packages can also be
	# downloaded and installed manually: seek local expert advice for this if
	# necessary
	pip install posix_ipc
	pip install pysnmp
	pip install numpy
	pip install h5py
	pip install pyzmq
	
	# Set the PYTHONPATH to point at the location of the tools
	export PYTHONPATH=<project root>/build/lib/python

The `pyzmq` python bindings for ZeroMQ do not require ZeroMQ to be installed, although this is requried to
build and run the compiled applications. There is, however, a potential conflict between `pyzmq` and ZeroMQ v3 
libraries on RedHat-based systems, causing python tools to fail when importing the bindings. If this occurs,
delete the bindings with the command `pip unintall pyzmq` and reinstall with 
`pip install pyzmq --install-option='--zmq=bundled'` to force installation of a local ZeroMQ library.

__NOTE__: unlike in the virtual environment, this installation method does __not__ create command-line
entry points for the python tools. In this case, invoking them requires `python` to run with a module
entry instead. For instance `port_counters ...` becomes `python -m port_counters ...`. 

Available python tools
----------------------

The following describe the available tools, and their configurations.

**emulator_client**

This tool allows the PERCIVAL emulator firmware, installed on a mezzanine system, to be configured and
controlled. Source and destination MAC and IP addresses can be set, frame transmission can be started
and stopped (depending on the firmware configuration). All setup is controlled via command-line arguments:

	(venv) $ emulator_client --help
	
	usage: emulator_client [-h] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--timeout TIMEOUT]
	                       [--delay DELAY] [--src0 SRC0] [--src1 SRC1]
	                       [--src2 SRC2] [--dst0 DST0] [--dst1 DST1] [--dst2 DST2]
	                       {stop,start,command}
	
	EmulatorClient - control hardware emulator start, stop & configure node(s)
	
	positional arguments:
	  {stop,start,command}  specify which command to send to emulator
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --host HOST           select emulator IP address
	  --port PORT           select emulator IP port
	  --timeout TIMEOUT     set TCP connection timeout
	  --delay DELAY         set delay between each address packet
	  --src0 SRC0           Configure Mezzanine link 0 IP:MAC addresses
	  --src1 SRC1           Configure Mezzanine link 1 IP:MAC addresses
	  --src2 SRC2           Configure Mezzanine link 2 IP:MAC addresses
	  --dst0 DST0           Configure PC link 0 IP:MAC addresses
	  --dst1 DST1           Configure PC link 1 IP:MAC addresses
	  --dst2 DST2           Configure PC link 2 IP:MAC addresses
	  
For instance, the firmware can be programmed with network parameters with the following:

	(venv) $ emulator_client --host 192.168.0.103 --port 4321 --delay 1.2 command \
	--src0 10.1.0.101:00-07-11-F0-FF-33 --dst0 10.1.0.1:00-07-43-10-63-00 \
	--src1 10.1.0.102:00-07-11-F0-FF-44 --dst1 10.1.0.2:00-07-43-10-5F-20 \
	--src2 10.1.0.103:00-07-11-F0-FF-55 --dst2 10.1.0.3:EC-F4-BB-CC-D3-A8
	
	Sending: 
	 24 bytes..  24 bytes..  24 bytes..  24 bytes..  24 bytes..  24 bytes..  26 bytes..  26 bytes..  26 bytes..  26 bytes..  26 bytes..  26 bytes.. 
	Waiting 3 seconds before closing TCP connection..
	 Done!

__NOTE__: the delay parameter is a debugging option that was used to investigate issues with loading multiple parameters in one step and 
may not be necessary. 

The emulator can then be triggered to start and stop producing frames, for instance with a short delay between the two:

	(venv) $ emulator_client --host 192.168.0.103 --port 4321 start; sleep 0.5; emulator_client --host 192.168.0.103 --port 4321 stop
	Transmitted start command
	Transmitted stop command
	
	  
**frame_producer**

This tool generates a simulated UDP packet stream, allowing the FrameReceiver to tested without
mezzanine hardware. 

	(venv) $ frame_producer --help
	
	usage: frame_producer [-h] [--destaddr [DESTADDR [DESTADDR ...]]]
	                      [--frames FRAMES] [--interval INTERVAL] [--display]
	
	FrameProducer - generate a simulated UDP frame data stream
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --destaddr [DESTADDR [DESTADDR ...]]
	                        list destination host(s) IP address:port (e.g.
	                        0.0.0.1:8081)
	  --frames FRAMES, -n FRAMES
	                        select number of frames to transmit
	  --interval INTERVAL, -t INTERVAL
	                        select frame interval in seconds
	  --display, -d         Enable diagnostic display of generated image
	  
__NOTE__: multiple destination address are supported.

For example, to transmit three frames total to frame receivers on three separate hosts:  

	(venv) $ frame_producer --destaddr 10.1.0.1:8000 10.1.0.2:8000 10.1.0.3:8000 --frames=3 --interval=0.1

	3 frames completed, 25348416 bytes sent in 0.601 secs


**frame_processor**

This tool emulates the frame processor / fileWriter application that handles received
frames downstream of the frameReceiver. Its primary purpose is to allow the debugging
of the inter-process communications and frame buffering in shared memory. All options
are exposed as arguments and can also be parsed from a configuration file:

	(venv) $ frame_processor --help
	
	usage: FrameProcessor [-h] [--config CONFIG_FILE] [--ctrl CTRL_ENDPOINT]
	                      [--sharedbuf SHAREDBUF] [--bypass_mode] [--packet_state]
	                      [--frames FRAMES] [--boost_mmap_mode]
	
	FrameProcessor - test harness to simulate operation of FrameProcessor
	application
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --config CONFIG_FILE, -c CONFIG_FILE
	                        Parse additional options from specified configuration
	                        file
	  --ctrl CTRL_ENDPOINT  Specify the IPC control channel endpoint URL
	  --sharedbuf SHAREDBUF
	                        Specify the name of the shared memory frame buffer
	  --bypass_mode         Enable frame decoding bypass mode
	  --packet_state        Enable printing of packet state info during frame
	                        decoding
	  --frames FRAMES       Specify the number of frames to receive before
	                        shutting down
	  --boost_mmap_mode     Enable boost MMAP shared memory mode
	  
Example usage:

	(venv) $ $ frame_processor --config test_config/fp_test.config --frames 3 --packet_state
	
will output diagnostic information about frames received and released by a frame receiver, 
including formatted printout of the packet receive state in each frame.	  

**port_counters**

This tool allows the packet count on the network interfaces of a switch (via SNMP) and a collection
of nodes (via SSH  and ifconfig) to be saved to files, and the differences between the two to be 
displayed:

	(venv) $ port_counters --help
	
	usage: port_counters [-h] [--addr SWITCH_ADDR] [start_file] [end_file]
	
	port_counters - capture port packet counters from a switch via SNMP and
	calculate deltas
	
	positional arguments:
	  start_file            JSON-formatted file containing starting switch
	                        counters for calculate mode (default: None)
	  end_file              JSON-formatted file containing starting switch
	                        counters for calculate mode (default: None)
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --addr SWITCH_ADDR, -a SWITCH_ADDR
	                        Address of switch to access (default: devswitch5920)

__NOTE__: In the current version, there is a mapping between nodes and ports defined in the 
script itself, which will require modification to suit the users' system configuration. The
script requires SSH access to each node (ideally via public key authentication loaded into
an SSH agent to avoid entering a password each time), and SNMP access to the switch to be enabled.

Invoked without a start or end file name, the tool will capture the current packet counter state
to a JSON-formatted file. This can be run twice, for instance before and after an acquisition sequence.
Invoked with a pair for file names, it will calculate and display the differences between the two
files.

**decode_raw_frames_hdf5**

This script will decode datasets of image/reset frames into separate datasets for fine & coarse ADC and
gain bits. The resulting datasets will be written back into the file. The original raw datasets remain 
un-modified in the file.

The script takes a single argument: the HDF5 file to operate on.

__NOTE__: This script will run on every single dataset found in the root of the file. So only run it once
and only on a raw datafile from the filewriter.
