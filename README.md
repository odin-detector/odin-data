odin-data is a modular, scalable, high-throughput data acquisition framework consisting
of two communicating applications; the FrameReceiver and FrameProcessor. It acts as a
data capture and processing pipeline for detector data streams transferred over a
network connection. The FrameReceiver constructs data frames in shared memory buffers
and the FrameProcessor performs processing on the buffer and writes data to disk.
