# FrameSimulatorPlugin

The `FrameSimulatorPlugin` is the base class for detector specific implementations that
can be loaded into the frameSimulator application.

This class defines a few virtual methods to be implemented by concrete implementations.
Some are pure virtual - annotated with `*` - and some are optional. These are:

- `populate_options`
- `setup`
- `simulate*`

These methods are used to provide options to `--help` output, parse commandline options
and run the simulation.

for more detail.
```

There is also a helper child class `FrameSimulatorPluginUDP` that provides some utility
for loading pcap files, providing virtual methods to process the file into packets, and
implements a generic `setup` and `simulate` methods. The methods for child classes to
implement are:

- `extract_frames*`
- `create_frames*`
